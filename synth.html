<h2>üéöÔ∏è Synth Concepts Primer</h2>

<p>Modular synthesis is the art of shaping sound through voltage. Each module performs a function ‚Äî generating, modifying, or routing signals ‚Äî and together they form a sonic architecture.</p>

<h3>üîå Signal Types</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Audio signals</strong>: Waveforms you hear (e.g. from VCOs)</li>
  <li><strong>Control voltages (CV)</strong>: Signals that shape other signals (e.g. pitch, filter cutoff)</li>
  <li><strong>Gate/Trigger</strong>: Binary pulses that start events (e.g. envelope, sequencer step)</li>
</ul>

<h3>üß† Why Modular?</h3>
<p>Modular synthesis is tactile logic. You patch ideas together, test them, reshape them. It‚Äôs engineering as improvisation ‚Äî a system that invites both structure and surprise.</p>
