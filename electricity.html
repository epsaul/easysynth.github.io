      <p>Electricity is the movement of charge — a restless flow of electrons seeking balance. It’s not just power; it’s potential. From the hum of a modular synth to the flicker of a filament, electricity animates the inert, connects the isolated, and transforms silence into signal.</p>

      <h2>🧠 At Its Core</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Atoms</strong> are made of protons (+), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (−).</li>
        <li><strong>Electrons</strong> can move between atoms, especially in conductive materials like copper.</li>
        <li>This movement — a flow of charge — is what we call <strong>electric current</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are two main types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Current (DC)</strong>: Electrons flow in one direction. Used in batteries, synth modules, and most low-voltage electronics.</li>
        <li><strong>Alternating Current (AC)</strong>: Electrons oscillate back and forth. Used in mains power and audio signals.</li>
      </ul>

            <td>Current (I)</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Resistance (R)</td>
            <td>Opposition to flow</td>
            <td>A narrow pipe slows the water</td>

      <h2>🎛️ Electricity in Synthesis</h2>
      <p>In modular synthesis, electricity becomes expressive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Control voltages (CV)</strong> shape pitch, filter cutoff, and modulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Gate and trigger signals</strong> define rhythm and timing.</li>
        <li><strong>Power rails</strong> distribute energy across modules, each drawing what it needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Electricity here isn’t just functional — it’s compositional.</p>

      <h2>🌍 Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Understanding electricity isn’t just for engineers. It’s for anyone who wants to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build, repair, or modify gear</li>
        <li>Troubleshoot signal paths</li>
        <li>Design circuits that behave with intention</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Electricity is the medium. Your ideas are the message.</p>
