    <h1>Colophon</h1>
    <p>This site was hand-built by Ed Saul as a Bauhaus-inspired exploration of synthesis — blending engineering, design, and sonic philosophy.</p>

    <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong></li>
      <li>Written in <strong>HTML, CSS, and Markdown</strong></li>
      <li>Visuals and audio demos created with <strong>Ubuntu Studio</strong> tools: GIMP, Ardour, Inkscape</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Inspired by Bauhaus principles: clarity, geometry, and functional beauty. The layout reflects modularity and minimalism, echoing the structure of synthesis itself.</p>

    <h2>Sonic Influences</h2>
    <p>Modular synthesis traditions — East Coast precision and West Coast experimentation — shape the site’s sonic philosophy and pedagogical approach.</p>

    <h2>Collaborative Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Creative support provided by <strong>Microsoft Copilot</strong>, blending digital intuition with human curiosity. All content is original unless otherwise noted.</p>

    <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
    <p>Thanks to the open-source community, synth pioneers, and curious minds who continue to push the boundaries of sound and design.</p>
<h2>Historical Inspiration</h2>
<p>
  This site owes a quiet debt to <em>Simple Electronics</em> (Ladybird Learnabout Series 634, 1979), 
  written by <strong>Rev. George C. Dobbs</strong> and illustrated by <strong>Roland Berry</strong>. 
  Its transistor organ and flip-flop circuits sparked early curiosity that now echoes through EasySynth’s modular ethos. 
  Though the AC128s have grown rare, the spirit of hands-on discovery endures.
